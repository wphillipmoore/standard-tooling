# Release 1.1.2 (2026-02-21)

## Bug fixes

- **handle empty docsite_files array with set -u**
The docsite_files array expansion fails with set -u (nounset) when no
docs/sphinx or docs/site directories exist. Use the ${arr[@]+...} pattern
to safely expand potentially empty arrays.

- **prevent --actions-compat from leaking during self-update re-exec**
The actions_compat variable was initialized to "false" (non-empty string).
During self-update re-exec, ${actions_compat:+--actions-compat} expands
to --actions-compat for any non-empty value, causing the re-exec to
incorrectly include the flag even when the user did not pass it.

Change the default to an empty string so the expansion correctly omits
the flag when --actions-compat was not specified.

- **accept cross-repo issue references in PR linkage check (#36)**
The regex in pr-issue-linkage.sh only matched local references (#123) but submit-pr.sh supports cross-repo references (owner/repo#123). Update the regex to accept both formats.


## Documentation

- **add canonical source comment to repo-profile.sh**
Test change for end-to-end propagation validation.

- **document release-before-sync requirement (#20)**
Consuming repos' CI checks tooling against the latest tagged release. Syncing from an unreleased ref causes CI failures. Added mandatory ordering to CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md.

- **ban MEMORY.md usage in CLAUDE.md (#32)**
Add auto-memory policy requiring agents to discuss behavioral rules with the human rather than storing them in unmanaged MEMORY.md files.

- **ban heredocs in shell commands (#33)**
Replace soft 'prefer temp files' guidance with explicit ban on heredocs. Heredocs routinely fail due to shell escaping and waste time debugging.


## Features

- **add CI workflow, CLAUDE.md, and repository infrastructure (#6)**
Add CI with docs-only, standards-compliance (skip-sync-check), and
shellcheck jobs.  Create CLAUDE.md, PR template, and .gitignore.
Fix workflow filename reference in docs/repository-standards.md.

- **add add-to-project workflow for standards project**
Adds a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically adds new issues
to the standards GitHub Project (#4).

- **add GitHub Project helper scripts for skill automation (#12)**
* feat: add GitHub Project helper scripts for skill automation

Add standalone shell scripts in scripts/gh/ that wrap gh CLI commands
for common GitHub Project operations. These eliminate ad-hoc code in
skills that need to query project metadata.

- list-project-repos.sh: list unique repos linked to a project
- ensure-label.sh: idempotent label check/create
- set-project-field.sh: resolve field/option names to IDs and set value

- **add ci and build to allowed conventional commit types (#13)**
Update both commit-message.sh (local hook) and commit-messages.sh (CI
range check) to accept ci: and build: prefixes, aligning with the
broader Conventional Commits specification.

- **add commit and PR submission wrapper scripts (#17)**
Wrapper scripts that construct standards-compliant commit messages and PR bodies programmatically, eliminating agent compliance failures for Co-Authored-By trailers and issue linkage.

- **support cross-repo issue references (#23)**
- **add VERSION file detector to prepare_release.py (#27)**
Adds detect_version_file() as a fallback detector. Validates semver format (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). Also adds VERSION file for this repo.

- **add category prefixes to CI job names (#31)**
Standardize job display names with ci: category prefix so checks cluster naturally in the GitHub status list.

- **add validate_local.sh dispatch architecture (#34)**
Shared driver reads primary_language from repo profile and dispatches to common, language-specific, and custom validation scripts. Adds validate_local.sh, validate_local_common.sh, validate_local_python.sh, validate_local_go.sh, validate_local_java.sh. Updates repo-profile.sh to validate primary_language field. Updates sync-tooling.sh MANAGED_FILES.

- **validate issue-linked branch names in pre-commit hook (#44)**
Feature, bugfix, and hotfix branches must follow {type}/{issue}-{description} format. Release branches are exempt (automated by publish workflow).

- **add publish workflow for automated tagging and version bumps (#46)**
* chore: bump version to 1.1.2
