# Release 1.2.0 (2026-02-23)

## Bug fixes

- **update add-to-project action to v1.0.2 (#64)**
- **read version from pyproject.toml in publish and docs workflows (#82)**
The v1.2.0 release merged to main but both post-merge workflows failed because they read from a VERSION file that no longer exists. Update publish.yml and docs.yml to use tomllib-based version extraction from pyproject.toml, matching the pattern used by mq-rest-admin-python. Also add setup-uv step for post-bump uv lock.


## Documentation

- **document git hooks and validation rules (#71)**
- **add MkDocs documentation site (#72)**
Add MkDocs/mike documentation site matching sibling repos pattern. Includes mkdocs.yml with Material theme, docs deployment workflow, 19 content pages covering all managed scripts, guides for consuming repos, validation matrix, and release workflow.

- **update documentation site for PATH-based architecture (#79)**
Rewrite all documentation pages to reflect the restructuring from a sync-tooling model to PATH-based consumption. Delete obsolete pages (co-author, commit-messages range validator, sync-tooling). Update all script paths, tool names, and consumption instructions.


## Features

- **add chore/ as allowed branch prefix in pre-commit hook (#66)**
- **restructure as Python package with PATH-based consumption (#73)**
Replace copy-and-sync model with checkout-and-PATH consumption. CLI tools become st-* Python entry points, bash validators move to scripts/bin/ (no .sh extensions), git hooks move to scripts/lib/git-hooks/. Drop co-author.sh, commit-messages.sh, sync-tooling.sh.

- **add commit-messages range validator for CI (#76)**
Port the commit-messages validator (range-based, for CI PR validation) from standard-actions back to scripts/bin/. This was dropped in the restructuring (#73) but is still needed by the standards-compliance action. Unlike the existing commit-message (singular) which validates a single file for the git hook, this script validates all non-merge commits in a base..head range.


## Refactoring

- **remove commit-messages range validator (#77)**
The CI commit message validation is being removed from the standards-compliance action. The git commit-msg hook provides sufficient enforcement at commit time. This removes the range-based validator added in the previous commit.


## Testing

- **achieve 100% line and branch coverage for all Python modules (#74)**
Add comprehensive tests for all lib and bin modules. Configure coverage exclusions for __main__ guards and TYPE_CHECKING blocks. Reformat source with ruff format for CI consistency.
