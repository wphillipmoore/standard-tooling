"""Finalize a repository after a PR merge.

Switches to the target branch, fast-forward pulls, deletes merged local
branches, and prunes stale remote-tracking references. After
validation succeeds, also checks the most recent Documentation
workflow run on the target branch and surfaces a warning if it
failed (issue #303 — docs publish is async and used to fail
silently).
